# TimCoreyPillReminderChallenge
Tim Corey Pill Reminder C# Weekly Challenge and my first project in C#
# Description
Pill Reminder that takes given list of pills and every five seconds, or on button click, 
refreshes a listbox of pills that need to be taken based on each pill's timeToTake and the current time.
From the listbox of pills to be taken, the user can select which pill to take and click a take pill button. This 
removes the pill from the listbox and updates the pill's LastTaken so that it will not be included in future refreshes until
the next time the pill needs to be taken.
# Example
